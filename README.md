# github-issue-template

A CLI for generating URLs to pre-filled GitHub issue forms

GitHub has a little-known feature that allows you to pass query params to the `/issues/new` page. Those query params can specify values to inject into the issue form's title and body inputs.

## Installation

```sh
npm i -g github-issue-template
```

## Usage

The CLI expects three arguments:

- `repo`
- `title`
- `body`

```sh
github-issue-template --repo sally/project --title "new thing" --body "the body"
```

If you want to use a file on disk as the body, `cat` comes to the rescue:

```sh
github-issue-template --repo sally/project --title "new thing" --body "$(cat some/file.md)"
```

## Dependencies

- [is-url](https://github.com/git+https:/): Check whether a string is a URL.
- [open](https://github.com/git+https:/): open a file or url in the user&#39;s preferred application
- [yargs](https://github.com/bcoe/yargs): Light-weight option parsing with an argv hash. No optstrings attached.
